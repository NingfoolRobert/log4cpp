Description

Log for C++ is a library of C++ classes for flexible logging to files, syslog (planned) and other destinations. It is modeled after the Log for Java library (http://www.log4j.org), staying as close to their API as is reasonable.

See the project page for more information: http://log4cpp.sourceforge.net.

License

I initially planned to license Log for C++ under the LGPL, but due to the comments on the FSF site (http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/why-not-lgpl.html), I switched GPL, at least for the initial release. Comments on this decision are appreciated.
