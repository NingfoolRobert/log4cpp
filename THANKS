The log4cpp library port from the LOG4J Java library was initiated by 
Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>. The current development team 
consists of Bastiaan Bakker, Cedric Le Goater, Steve Ostlind and Marcel 
Harkema. 

This project would not have existed without Ceki Gülcü <cgu@urbanet.ch>, the 
maintainer of LOG4J.
