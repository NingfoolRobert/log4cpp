The log4cpp library was ported from the LOG4J Java library by Bastiaan Bakker
<bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>. 

This project would not have existed without Ceki Gülcü <cgu@urbanet.ch>, the 
maintainer of LOG4J.

Cedric Le Goater <cedric@legoater.com> provided the autoconf setup.
Marc Welz <marc@jade.cs.uct.ac.za> (IdsaAppender)
Lynn Owen <opl@agoby.com> (MSVC++ support)
