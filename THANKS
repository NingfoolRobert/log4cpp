The log4cpp library port from the LOG4J Java library was initiated by 
Bastiaan Bakker <bastiaan.bakker@lifeline.nl>. The current development team 
consists of Bastiaan Bakker, Cedric Le Goater and Steve Ostlind. 

This project would not have existed without Ceki Gülcü <cgu@urbanet.ch>, the 
maintainer of LOG4J.

Cedric Le Goater <cedric@legoater.com> provided the autoconf setup.
Marc Welz <marc@jade.cs.uct.ac.za> (IdsaAppender)
Lynn Owen <opl@agoby.com> (MSVC++ support)
Steve Ostlind <s.ostlind@pentasafe.com> (MSVC++ support, various fixes)
