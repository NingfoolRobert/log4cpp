Log for C++ installation.
=========================

As of version 0.2.0 log4cpp can be build using configure. Simply do:
./configure
make
make install

This will install log4cpp under /usr/local. To install in another localation specify --prefix=<location> when running configure. 

Build Requiremnts.
==================

The primary development platform for log4cpp is RedHat Linux 7.0, which contains g++ version "2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)". As a consequence new versions may occasinally break compatibility with older g++ versions. Please report these compile problems as bugs. The aim is to have log4cpp compile on GNU/Linux BSD and UNIX platforms with g++ >= 2.91. 

For the generation of documentation you need to have installed the Doxygen package created by Dimitry van Heesch (see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html). The current documenation has been generated with Doxygen 1.2.1, older versions may or may not work.
