Log for C++ installation.
=========================

Log4cpp has been succesfully build on Linux (g++ >= 2.91), Tru64 UNIX (DEC++) and Win32 (MSVC6++). Very likely, it will work on other POSIX platforms too. If you do use log4cpp on a platform not listed yet, please drop us a note.

As of version 0.2.0 log4cpp can be build using configure on platforms supporting it. Simply do:
./configure
make
make install

This will install log4cpp under /usr/local. To install in another localation specify --prefix=<location> when running configure. 

On Win32, use the project files in the msvc6 dir to build the library and the test programs.

Build Requiremnts.
==================

The primary development platform for log4cpp is RedHat Linux 7.0, which contains g++ version "2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.0)". As a consequence new versions may occasinally break compatibility with older g++ versions. Please report these compile problems as bugs. The aim is to have log4cpp compile on GNU/Linux, BSD and UNIX platforms with g++ >= 2.91. As of 0.2.2 Win32 has been added to this list.

For the generation of documentation you need to have installed the Doxygen package created by Dimitry van Heesch (see http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html). The current documenation has been generated with Doxygen 1.2.5, older versions may or may not work.

Platform Specific Build Instructions
====================================
 
POSIX - g++
---------
Use './configure; make; make install'. 
g++ >= 2.91 is required. 
 
Solaris - Sun CC compiler
---------------
Compilation with Suns CC compiler requires setting some enviroment variables.
Also static libraries appear not to work. In short do:
 
CC=CC CXX=CC LD="CC -KPIC" ./configure --disable-static

Win32 - MSVC++ 6
--------------
Use the workspace and project files in subdirectory msvc6.
Building log4cpp with MSVC++ 5 is not supported and will not be, unless 
someone can find a way to do so without mutilating the source code.

Win32 - Borland C++ Builder 5
---------------------------
Use the project and make files in subdirectory bcb5

Win32 - Cygwin
------------
Use './configure; make; make install'. 
Be warned that there have been very few success or failure reports for this
platform, so either it works very smoothly or noone actively uses log4cpp
with Cygwin :-)

OpenVMS
-------
Do the usual (I presume you know better what that is than I do). Edit 
include/log4cpp/config-openvms.h if you need different settings.
[Tony may want to add some wise words here]
